## ✨ Key Features

- 🌞 **Real-Time Monitoring**  
  LDR-based sensing with **7-segment display output** (levels 0–7) for instant light intensity feedback.

- ⏱️ **Stabilization Logic**  
  Configurable delay (**30–300 s**) filters out short-term fluctuations to ensure stable readings.

- 📊 **Average Intensity Display**  
  Rolling average tracking (**300–900 s**) visualizes long-term lighting trends.
